# Testing Guide - Upload Wardrobe Flow

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- localStorage is **separate** between different ports (`localhost:3000` vs `localhost:5173`)
- When you uploaded images on the main app and clicked "Save", the data was stored in port 3000's localStorage
- When the classifier app opened on port 5173, it had **no access** to port 3000's localStorage
- Result: Classifier always showed Step 1 (upload screen) instead of Step 2 (wardrobe view)

### Solution
Implemented **postMessage API** for cross-origin communication:
1. Main app (port 3000) uploads images and stores them locally
2. When "Save" is clicked, it opens the classifier app in a new tab
3. After 2 seconds (to allow page load), it sends the image data via `postMessage`
4. Classifier app (port 5173) listens for `LOAD_WARDROBE` messages
5. When received, it automatically categorizes the images using Gemini AI
6. User sees the wardrobe view (Step 2) with all items categorized!

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/UploadWardrobe.jsx**
   - Updated `handleContinue()` to use `window.open()` and `postMessage()`
   - Sends uploaded images to classifier via cross-origin message

2. **Ashar/ai-wardrobe-stylist/App.tsx**
   - Added second `useEffect` to listen for `postMessage` events
   - Validates origin (security: only accepts from `localhost:3000`)
   - Automatically categorizes received images
   - Populates wardrobe state with categorized items

## How to Test

### Step 1: Start Both Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Main App
cd /Users/ashmitmishra/Desktop/HackFashion-AI
npm run dev
# Should run on http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2 - Classifier App
cd /Users/ashmitmishra/Desktop/HackFashion-AI/Ashar/ai-wardrobe-stylist
npm run dev
# Should run on http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 2: Test the Upload Flow
1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Click the **"Upload Your Wardrobe"** heading (the rainbow gradient heading)
3. Drag & drop 3-6 clothing images (PNG, JPG, WEBP)
4. You should see thumbnails of uploaded images
5. Click the **"Save"** button
6. A new tab will open at `http://localhost:5173`
7. **Expected Result**: You should see:
   - Loading spinner while AI categorizes
   - After ~5-10 seconds, your wardrobe items appear in Step 2
   - Items are categorized (tops, bottoms, shoes, etc.)
   - You can scroll down to "Generate Outfit" section

### Step 3: Verify Console Logs
Open browser DevTools (F12) on the classifier tab and check console:

**You should see:**
```
ðŸ‘‚ Listening for postMessage from main app...
ðŸ“¨ Received message: {type: 'LOAD_WARDROBE', images: Array(6)}
âœ… Received 6 images via postMessage
ðŸ¤– Starting AI categorization...
âœ… Categorization complete: [...]
âœ… Wardrobe loaded with 6 items from postMessage
```

## Troubleshooting

### Images Don't Load in Classifier
- **Check console**: Look for "Ignoring message from unknown origin"
  - If you see this, verify main app is on port 3000
  - The classifier only accepts messages from `http://localhost:3000`
  
- **Check timing**: postMessage is sent after 2 second delay
  - If classifier loads slowly, increase timeout in UploadWardrobe.jsx
  - Current: `setTimeout(..., 2000)` - try `3000` or `4000`

### "Save" Button Does Nothing
- Check browser popup blocker - classifier opens in new tab
- Look for errors in main app console (F12 on localhost:3000)

### AI Categorization Fails
- Check `.env.local` in `Ashar/ai-wardrobe-stylist/`
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check API quota/limits in Google AI Studio

## Expected Behavior Summary

| Action | Main App (3000) | Classifier (5173) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Upload images | Stores to state & localStorage | N/A |
| Click "Save" | Opens classifier via `window.open()` | Loads page |
| 2 seconds later | Sends postMessage with images | Receives message |
| After message | Closes upload view | Categorizes images with AI |
| Final state | Returns to features page | Shows wardrobe (Step 2) |

## Success Criteria
âœ… Upload images on main app
âœ… Click "Save" â†’ New tab opens
âœ… Classifier automatically loads images
âœ… AI categorization happens without manual upload
âœ… Wardrobe view (Step 2) displays with categorized items
âœ… No need to re-upload images in classifier

## Next Steps
Once this flow is working:
- Add error handling for failed postMessage
- Add loading indicator on classifier while waiting for message
- Consider adding "Back to main app" button
- Implement outfit generation and recommendations
