# UI Updates - Loading State & Dark Theme

## Changes Made

### 1. **Loading State While Waiting for Data** ✨
Added a beautiful loading spinner that shows while waiting for postMessage data (3 seconds max).

**What you'll see:**
- Animated cyan spinner
- "Loading Your Wardrobe..." with gradient text
- "Preparing your items for AI categorization" subtitle
- Prevents showing empty Step 1 upload screen while data is loading

**Code Changes:**
- `App.tsx`: Added `isWaitingForData` state
- Shows loading UI for 3 seconds or until data is received
- Automatically hides when wardrobe items are loaded

### 2. **Dark Theme - Gen-Z Color Palette** 🎨
Updated all components to match main app's aesthetic:

**Color Scheme:**
- Background: `#0b0f1a` (deep navy)
- Darker sections: `#05060a` (near-black)
- Accent cyan: `#00f5d4` (neon cyan)
- Accent pink: `#ff3cac` (hot magenta)
- Text: `#f7f8fb` (off-white)
- Muted text: `#b6c3d9` (slate)

**Components Updated:**

1. **Header**
   - Dark background with cyan border
   - Gradient title (pink → cyan)
   - Cyan sparkles icon

2. **Wardrobe (Step 2)**
   - Dark glass-morphism cards
   - Cyan borders with pink hover effect
   - Category badges with cyan accent

3. **ImageUploader (Step 1)**
   - Dark upload dropzone
   - Cyan dashed border (pink on hover)
   - Gradient button (pink → cyan)

4. **OutfitGenerator (Step 3)**
   - Dark input fields with cyan borders
   - Cyan focus rings
   - Gradient submit button

5. **OutfitSuggestions**
   - Gradient heading
   - Dark cards with cyan borders
   - Styled outfit displays

### 3. **Better UX Flow** 🚀

**Before:**
```
Open classifier → Shows Step 1 immediately → Wait → Data arrives → Reload needed
```

**After:**
```
Open classifier → Loading spinner (max 3s) → Data arrives → Shows Step 2 directly!
```

**Timeline:**
- 0s: Classifier opens, shows loading spinner
- 2s: PostMessage sent from main app
- 2-3s: Data received, AI categorization starts
- 5-10s: Wardrobe items appear (Step 2)
- No Step 1 ever shown! ✨

### 4. **Visual Consistency** 🎯

Both apps now share:
- Same color palette
- Same glassmorphism effects
- Same gradient buttons
- Same border styles
- Same typography

This creates a seamless experience when transitioning from main app to classifier!

## Testing

1. **Test Loading State:**
   - Open classifier directly at `localhost:5173`
   - Should see loading spinner for 3 seconds
   - Then shows Step 1 (no data received)

2. **Test Full Flow:**
   - Upload images on main app
   - Click "Save"
   - Classifier opens with loading spinner
   - After ~2s, spinner disappears
   - Wardrobe items appear (Step 2)
   - Everything is dark-themed with cyan/pink accents!

3. **Visual Check:**
   - Header: Gradient title ✅
   - Cards: Dark with cyan borders ✅
   - Buttons: Gradient pink → cyan ✅
   - Inputs: Dark with cyan focus ✅
   - Text: Off-white on dark ✅
